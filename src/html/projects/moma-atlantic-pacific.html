			<h1 class="">Project <i>MoMA Atlantic Pacific</i></h1>

			<p>We created a program that would over a 6 week period, tease an installation in the Brooklyn Atlantic Pacific Station, then delight commuters with an engaging interactive display of over 50 works from MoMA's permanent collection.</p>

			<p>This was my first high profile project that would go on the receive both high traffic and acclaim. This was in 2008 when the browser was a <i>much</i> different thing than it is today. I was faced with the challange of creating single page web applicaiont that would animate between screens as if the user was looking out the window of the subway.</p>
