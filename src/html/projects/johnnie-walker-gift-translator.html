			<p>Johnnie Walker departed from the global strategy "Keep Walking" for the 2010 holiday season. We created the "Say It Without Saying It" campaign to speak to men who have trouble expressing their feelings, especially to other men. In addition to the :30 spots we created an interactive "gift translator" that was shared across the internet. I worked on the digital concepts and executions behind this campaign.</p>
