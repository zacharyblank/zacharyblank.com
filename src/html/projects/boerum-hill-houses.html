			<h1 class="">Project <i>Boerum Hill Houses</i></h1>

			<p>Boerum Hill is a lifestyle and hospitality brand offering a unique suite of products and services for active, creative professionals in and around burgeoning cities. Unlike country clubs, vacation resorts and hotels, Boerum Hill is focused on creating a curated experience for its guests that is thoughtful, refined and individual. Itâ€™s flagship product, the Boerum Hill Houses, is set on 100 acres in central Oregon just minutes from downtown Bend. This rural getaway is fully sustainable and features a restaurant, farm, event space, lake and boathouse, pool and 30 retreat houses for rent year round. From the moment guests enter the property, their every whim is catered to, from pre-adjusted bicycles to fully stocked bars.</p>

			<p>Each retreat house, from the studios to the three bedrooms, is individually designed and adorned with private outdoor soaking tubs and showers, grills and hammocks. Inside will feature premium Brooklinen bedding, Pendleton wools, high speed wifi and a pantry stocked with farm fresh food and chef inspired recipes for those who would rather dine in. After a day of mountain biking, skiing or just relaxing in the sun, guests have every comfort available to them in their own private retreat in Central Oregon.</p>

			<p>In addition to the retreat houses, the property will feature a restaurant with true farm-to-table, American Homestyle cooking; guests of the houses are guaranteed a seat while restaurant visitors are welcome to make reservations. Adjacent is the clubhouse, ideal for parties, concerts, weddings and corporate events.</p>

			<p>Central Oregon has long been a destination for leisure and outdoor enthusiasts. The Boerum Hill Houses is just minutes from the lifts at Mt. Bachelor, climbing at Smith Rock, rafting and fishing in the Deschutes River, mountain biking, hiking, and relaxing all around. Boerum Hill will be the first, and last, destination for those who expect a higher level of service and experience. </p>
